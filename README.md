# CSC207 - Mahjong Score Trainer

A simple Mahjong Score Trainer that includes a score calculator, a training mode, and a puzzle rush mode.

## Overview

There are 3 main views this program will have: a **Point Calculator**, a **Puzzle Rush**, and the **Leaderboard**. In the Point Calculator mode, users are given a UI in which they will input a Mahjong Hand and the program will output the score that the hand is worth. In the Puzzle Rush mode, users are given a time limit and are tasked with inputting as many scores as they can. Once done, the number of hands they scored are tallied and they will be shown a leaderboard on how they compare to other users.
