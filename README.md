# CSC207 - Mahjong Score Trainer

A simple Mahjong Score Trainer that includes a score calculator, a training mode, and a puzzle rush mode. 

There are 3 main modes this program will have: a **Point Calculator** mode, a **Point Trainer** mode, and a **Puzzle Rush** mode. In the Point Calculator mode, users are given a UI in which they will input a Mahjong Hand and the program will output the score that the hand is worth. In the Point Trainer mode, users are given a hand and are asked to input the points that the hand is expected to receive. In the Puzzle Rush mode, users are given a time limit and are tasked with inputting as many scores as they can. Once done, the number of hands they scored are tallied and they will be shown a leaderboard on how they compare to other users.
