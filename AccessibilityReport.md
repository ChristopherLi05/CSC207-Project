# Accessibility Report

## Principle 1: Equitable Use
- We used a font that is easy-to-read, a large font size, and distinguishable colors (i.e., not something like gray against dark gray or green against red) across all of our windows to ensure that our program wouldn't be difficult to use for users with mild visual impairments.
- We could improve our product's adherence to this principle by adding features such as screen readers and adaptable input methods.
- Screen readers would make our product accessible for users with more severe visual impairments, and adaptable input methods like a voice recognition system that allows users to interact with the product verbally would make our product usable for Mahjong players with visual- and/or mobility-related disabilities.

## Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
- We created a puzzle rush mode in which the user tries to match the scores of randomly generated Mahjong hands one by one. This feature invites users who want to improve their abilities to read Mahjong hands and/or want to play a simple Mahjong-related mini-game.
- We could better adhere to this principle by creating a trainer mode that helps beginners learn how to read Mahjong hands from scratch at their own pace. This feature makes our product of interest to a new market segment, thus increasing its flexibility in use.

## Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
- Ensuring that our product is accessible to users of various skill levels (e.g., users who do not understand all Mahjong terms) was not a high priority for us since our audience (people who want to calculate their Mahjong hands) are guaranteed to have enough knowledge to properly use our product.
- To elaborate, anyone who wants to calculate a Mahjong hand would more than likely have enough knowledge to play a Mahjong game, and this is enough knowledge to properly use our product.

## Principle 4: Perceptible Information
- We included instructions in the calculator, puzzle rush, and leaderboard windows that inform users about the window and how to use the features available.
- We could further improve our product’s adherence to this principle by creating a tour feature that shows users the available features in the product, as well as how to use the features.

## Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
- We included a clear button below the component that displays the hand the user constructs so that the mistakes they make aren’t permanent.
- We can improve our product’s adherence to this principle by implementing a feature that allows users to dynamically remove individual tiles or tile groups without clearing the entire hand by clicking on the individual tile or tile group.

## Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
- One feature that facilitates low physical effort is the hand being updated with one click on a tile (in the calculator window), rather than something like selecting a tile then pressing an add button.
- We could further improve the product’s adherence to this design principle by allowing users to operate parts of the product with their keyboard. For instance, we could make it so that the login button in the login screen responds to the user pressing the enter key.

## Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
- There is sufficient space between the containers and components of our windows. We also made our buttons large enough for users to click comfortably.
- We could further adhere to this principle by implementing support for resizing the interface to give more comfort and ease of use to users of different screen sizes or accessibility needs.

If we were to market the program to customers, we’d market it to Mahjong players who primarily play on online platforms but wish to transition to playing in person. Most online Mahjong clients such as MahjongSoul, 10hou, and Riichi City calculate the score of a player’s hand automatically. As a result, many players are unfamiliar with the process of scoring their hands, which is a critical skill for offline play. Our calculator bridges this gap by providing an easy way to calculate scores during offline games, and our puzzle rush mode provides an opportunity for players to practice their hand scoring skills on the side. In conclusion, our product empowers online Mahjong players to confidently engage in traditional Mahjong, and those players are who we would market our product to.

The product is less likely to be used by individuals with severe visual or mobility impairments. Although we have implemented features that make our product adhere to all Principles of Universal Design to an exten
